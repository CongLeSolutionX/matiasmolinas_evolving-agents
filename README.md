# Evolving Agents Framework

A toolkit for agent autonomy, evolution, and governance. Create agents that can understand requirements, evolve through experience, communicate effectively, and build new agents and tools - all while operating within governance guardrails.

## Why the World Needs This Toolkit
Current agent systems are designed primarily for humans to build and control AI agents. The Evolving Agents Ecosystem takes a fundamentally different approach: agents building agents.

Our toolkit provides:

- **Autonomous Evolution**: Agents learn from experience and improve themselves without human intervention
- **Agent Self-Discovery**: Agents discover and collaborate with other specialized agents to solve complex problems
- **Governance Firmware**: Enforceable guardrails that ensure agents evolve and operate within safe boundaries
- **Self-Building Systems**: The ability for agents to create new tools and agents when existing ones are insufficient
- **Agent-Centric Architecture**: Communication and capabilities built for agents themselves, not just their human creators

Instead of creating yet another agent framework, we build on existing frameworks like BeeAI to create a layer that enables agent autonomy, evolution, and self-governance - moving us closer to truly autonomous AI systems that improve themselves while staying within safe boundaries.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Agent Evolution**: Reuse, adapt, or create agents based on semantic similarity to existing components
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Enable specialized agents to delegate tasks and collaborate on complex problems
- **Smart Library with Semantic Search**: Find the most relevant tools and agents using OpenAI embeddings
- **Self-improving System**: Agents get better over time through continuous evolution and learning
- **Human-readable YAML Workflows**: Define complex agent collaborations with simple, version-controlled YAML
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Seamlessly integrate agents from different frameworks (BeeAI, OpenAI, etc.)
- **Governance through Firmware**: Enforce domain-specific rules across all agents
- **Service Bus Architecture**: Connect agents through a unified communication system with pluggable backends

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/evolving-agents-framework.git
cd evolving-agents-framework

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Setup the agent library
python examples/setup_simplified_agent_library.py

# Run the comprehensive example
python examples/simplified_agent_communication.py
```

## Example: Agent Collaboration via Service Bus

```python
# Initialize the SystemAgent with LLM
llm_service = LLMService(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o")
system_agent = SystemAgent(llm_service)

# The SystemAgent is a BeeAI ReActAgent that can:
# 1. Interact with the SmartLibrary through specialized library tools
# 2. Manage the Service Bus through specialized service bus tools
# 3. Create and evolve agents as needed

# Initialize tools for the SystemAgent
await system_agent.initialize_tools()

# Ask the SystemAgent to set up a document processing workflow
response = await system_agent.run("""
Please set up a document processing workflow with these components:
1. A document analyzer tool that can identify document types
2. A data extraction agent that can extract structured data from documents
3. A summarization agent that can create concise summaries
Then process this invoice: 
INVOICE #12345
Date: 2023-05-15
Vendor: TechSupplies Inc.
Total Due: $1,822.80
""")

print(response.result.text)
```

## Use Cases

- **Document Processing**: Create specialized agents for different document types that collaborate to extract and analyze information
- **Healthcare**: Medical agents communicating with pharmacy and insurance agents to coordinate patient care
- **Financial Analysis**: Portfolio management agents collaborating with market analysis agents
- **Customer Service**: Routing agents delegating to specialized support agents
- **Multi-step Reasoning**: Break complex problems into components handled by specialized agents
