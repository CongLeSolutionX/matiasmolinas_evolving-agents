EAT is a Python toolkit for constructing advanced, multi-agent applications where autonomy, adaptability, and robust orchestration are crucial. It enables the implementation of **AI-First strategies**, where agent-driven workflows are designed to handle tasks that complex human workflows are currently capable of doing. Move beyond simple agent chains to create ecosystems that can dynamically respond to requirements, learn from interactions, and improve over timeâ€”all within defined governance boundaries.

## Why Evolving Agents Toolkit for AI-First?

Building true **AI-First systems**â€”where agent workflows are capable of handling tasks currently performed in complex human processesâ€”requires more than just individual agents. EAT focuses on orchestrating the entire **agent ecosystem**:

*   **ðŸŽ¯ Goal-Oriented Orchestration:** Interact via high-level goals given to a central `SystemAgent` (e.g., "Process this invoice," "Generate a project backlog from this meeting transcript"). The `SystemAgent` handles the complex "how," mimicking a project manager coordinating resources. It plans, finds or creates components, executes tasks, and manages internal workflows derived from the goal. You state the objective; the system orchestrates the execution.
*   **ðŸ§  Intelligent Component Management & Discovery:** A `SmartLibrary` acts as a central repository for reusable agents and tools, enabling semantic search (find tools based on *what they do*, not just names) and versioning. This allows the system to discover and leverage existing capabilities efficiently.
*   **ðŸšŒ Dynamic Communication & Service Bus:** The `SmartAgentBus` (with distinct System and Data buses) allows agents to discover and request capabilities across the system dynamically, decoupling components and enabling flexible interactions similar to microservices.
*   **ðŸŒ± Adaptive Evolution:** Components aren't static. EAT provides mechanisms (`EvolveComponentTool`) for the `SystemAgent` to evolve agents and tools based on new requirements, performance feedback, or changing contexts, enabling the system to adapt and improve over time.
*   **ðŸ§© Modular & Interoperable:** Seamlessly integrate agents and tools built with different frameworks (e.g., BeeAI, OpenAI Assistants SDK) via a flexible provider system (`AgentFactory`, `ToolFactory`, `providers/`). Define clear operational rules and safety guardrails using `Firmware`.
*   **ðŸ¤– Self-Management & Improvement:** The architecture allows system agents like `SystemAgent` and (optionally) `ArchitectZero` to collaboratively design, implement, manage, and even improve the ecosystem, including the toolkit's own components (see `examples/self_improvement/evolve_smart_library.py`).

**In short: If you aim to build AI-First systems that are more than the sum of their partsâ€”systems that can coordinate diverse capabilities, adapt to new challenges, and manage complexity autonomouslyâ€”EAT provides the essential structure and tools.**

## Key Features

*   **`SystemAgent` Orchestrator:** A central ReAct agent (using BeeAI) acting as the primary entry point. It uses specialized tools to manage the entire component lifecycle (search, create, evolve) and task execution based on high-level goals.
*   **`SmartLibrary`:** Persistent storage (`smart_library.json`) with semantic search (vector embeddings via ChromaDB), versioning, and evolution capabilities for agents & tools.
*   **`SmartAgentBus` (Dual Bus):** Manages agent registration, discovery, health monitoring (System Bus), and capability-based requests/communication (Data Bus), logging interactions (`agent_bus_logs_demo.json`).
*   **Internal Workflow Engine:** For complex goals, the `SystemAgent` can *internally* generate and execute multi-step YAML workflows (`GenerateWorkflowTool`, `ProcessWorkflowTool`), abstracting this complexity from the user.
*   **Component Evolution:** Adapt agents/tools using different strategies (e.g., standard, conservative, aggressive, domain adaptation) orchestrated by the `SystemAgent` via `EvolveComponentTool`.
*   **Multi-Framework Support:** Pluggable provider architecture (`providers/`, `AgentFactory`, `ToolFactory`) allows integrating components built with different SDKs (e.g., `BeeAIProvider`, `OpenAIAgentsProvider`). Adapters (`adapters/`) bridge interfaces (e.g., `OpenAIToolAdapter`).
*   **Governance & Safety:** Define operational rules and safety constraints via `Firmware` and apply them during component creation/evolution or runtime (e.g., `OpenAIGuardrailsAdapter`).
*   **(Optional) `ArchitectZero`:** A specialized agent (see `agents/architect_zero.py`) that can be called *internally* by the `SystemAgent` (via the Agent Bus) to design complex multi-component solutions based on requirements.

pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

**1. Setup Environment:**

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file and add your API keys (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY)
# nano .env  OR use your preferred editor

**2. Run the Comprehensive Demo:**

This demo showcases the `SystemAgent` orchestrating a complex task (invoice processing) based on a high-level goal. It demonstrates component discovery, potential creation/evolution (using its internal tools), and execution.

```bash
python examples/invoice_processing/architect_zero_comprehensive_demo.py
```

**3. Explore Output:**

After the demo runs, check the generated files in the main directory (or as specified in the demo script):

*   `final_processing_output.json`: Contains the final structured JSON result from the `SystemAgent`, potentially including its detailed thought process log.
*   `smart_library_demo.json`: The state of the component library (`SmartLibrary`) after the run, showing created/evolved components.
*   `smart_agent_bus_demo.json`: The state of the agent registry on the `SmartAgentBus`.
*   `agent_bus_logs_demo.json`: Logs of agent interactions via the System and Data buses.

*(**Note:** This comprehensive demo is currently the primary quick start. Explore the `examples/` directory for more focused use cases.)*

## Roadmap / Future Work

*   **Smart Context & Memory (Enhanced Retrieval):** Implement a `SmartContext` providing intelligent key-value storage and message history. A key planned enhancement is a **Dual Embedding Strategy** for the knowledge base, creating separate embeddings for raw content (`E_orig`) and LLM-generated task applicability/reasoning (`E_raz`). This aims to significantly improve the retrieval of task-specific context for agents, making the provided information more relevant and reducing noise. Managed potentially by a `SmartMemory` component.
*   **Smart Cache:** Introduce `SmartCache` that selectively caches successful LLM calls (e.g., high-quality generations) for agent/tool improvement feedback loops.
*   **Enhanced Evolution:** Leverage `SmartContext`, `SmartMemory`, and `SmartCache` to further automate and refine agent/tool evolution, potentially including LLM fine-tuning based on performance.
*   **Enhanced Observability:** Improve logging and distributed tracing across components for better debugging, monitoring, and performance analysis of agent workflows.
*   **More Providers:** Add support for other agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen).
*   **UI Integration:** Explore options for a basic UI for monitoring the agent bus, library, and task execution.
*   **Testing:** Expand unit and integration test coverage significantly (`tests/`).
