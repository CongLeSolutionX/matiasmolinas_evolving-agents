TASK REQUIREMENT:

    Create an advanced invoice processing system that improves upon the basic version in the library. The system should:
    
    1. Use a more sophisticated document analyzer that can detect invoices with higher confidence
    2. Extract comprehensive information (invoice number, date, vendor, items, subtotal, tax, total)
    3. Verify calculations to ensure subtotal + tax = total
    4. Generate a structured summary with key insights
    5. Handle different invoice formats and detect potential errors
    
    The system should leverage existing components from the library when possible,
    evolve them where improvements are needed, and create new components for missing functionality.
    
    Please generate a complete workflow for this invoice processing system.
    

AGENT THOUGHT PROCESS:
The advanced invoice processing system workflow has been successfully created. It includes steps for high-confidence invoice detection, comprehensive data extraction, calculation verification, structured summary generation, multi-format handling, and error detection. If you need further details or the YAML file, please let me know!
