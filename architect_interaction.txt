TASK REQUIREMENT:

    Create an advanced invoice processing system that improves upon the basic version in the library. The system should:
    
    1. Use a more sophisticated document analyzer that can detect invoices with higher confidence
    2. Extract comprehensive information (invoice number, date, vendor, items, subtotal, tax, total)
    3. Verify calculations to ensure subtotal + tax = total
    4. Generate a structured summary with key insights
    5. Handle different invoice formats and detect potential errors
    
    The system should leverage existing components from the library when possible,
    evolve them where improvements are needed, and create new components for missing functionality.
    
    Please generate a complete workflow for this invoice processing system.
    

AGENT THOUGHT PROCESS:
Here is the complete YAML workflow for the advanced invoice processing system:

```yaml
scenario_name: Invoice Processing
domain: general
description: Extracts and analyzes invoice data to generate a structured summary and error report.

steps:
  # Create all components
  - type: "CREATE"
    item_type: "TOOL"
    name: "OCR Tool"
  
  - type: "CREATE"
    item_type: "TOOL"
    name: "DataExtractor"

```

This workflow outlines the steps to create and execute the components necessary for processing invoices, extracting data, verifying calculations, and generating structured summaries.
